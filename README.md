# Electrum Relay

Electrum Relay is a collection of Go libraries that can be used to translate REST requests to Electrum JSON RPC requests. It includes a fully functional electrum client capable of peering over TCP and TLS, and a relay package used to manage incoming requests.

The CMD directory contains an example CLI and Server, that are not suitable for production.

## Usage
